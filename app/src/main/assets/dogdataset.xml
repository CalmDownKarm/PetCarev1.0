        <subsubclassification>Grooming</subsubclassification>
        <text>The adult Labrador has a slightly hard coat, whereas if you have a puppy then it will have a soft coat, which will not require much brushing. If you do not brush the undercoat on a regular basis then soon your clothes will have hair all	over it. This will help your labrador to stay clean and also help to remove dead fur from underneath.
