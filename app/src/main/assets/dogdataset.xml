            The adult Labrador has a slightly hard coat, whereas a puppy posseses a soft coat, which does not require much brushing. The undercoat should be brushed regularly to prevent shedding. This will also help your Labrador to stay clean as dead fur is removed from the undercoat.

            Grooming a Cocker Spaniel is one of the most tedious and time consuming tasks. Its long silky fur has to be brushed and groomed regularly else it will get tangled and become extremely painful for the dog. Regular brushing will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup and the mouth of the Cocker Spaniel remains clean .This will also prevent the onset of any periodontal problems.To avoid any injury to the feet especially during running or playing, the nails of the dog should be trimmed regularly and kept short.Many vets advise the trimming of the hair in the inside of the ear so that there is ventilation under the ears,which would avoid the onset of ear infections.

            Grooming your Irish Setter will take a lot of time and effort.The long and silky coat will need every day brushing to ensure that it remains soft and lustrous. You need to follow the regular grooming regime in your pet i.e brushing the teeth and clipping toe nails.Clipping nails is very important as dog nails have veins in them and if they get chipped then it can be very painful for your pet.

            This is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. It can also happen due to a twist in the stomach. If your dog suffers from bloating then the meals should be broken into two to three meals a day.

            The smooth and short hair coat does not need much
            grooming. You just need to brush them once a week to get rid of all the
            loose hair from their bodies. They do not carry a distinctive odour, so a bath once every few
            weeks is enough.

            Gastric Dilation Volvulus\n
            This commonly occurs in breeds where the stomach is not attached to the ribs. This can cut off the blood supply to various other parts of the body, which further shuts down the digestion process. Such a situation leads to bloating. It is advisable to not exercise your dog for at least an hour after they have food.

            Chow Chow or Chow as they are popularly known are one of the most beautiful and admired dogs in the world.
            On first glance, the dog looks like a cross between a lion and a bear as it has a
            beautiful mane of fur around its head and the facial features resemble that of a bear.
            Though they look extremely cute and cuddly, they are quite aggresive.

            A Chow Chow has a two layered coat - one rough and one smooth. The top layer of the fur is
            rough and requires frequent brushing to keep it tangle free and clean.
            Chows are seasonal shedders and shed heavily. They also require regular baths as their fur gets
            dirty when they play in the yard or garden.
            Dental grooming is also a must for a Chow Chow. Regular brushing will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup.

            Doberman is one of the easiest breeds to groom. The coat of a Doberman Pinscher is short and does not shed much, so they require very little grooming.Its skin is extremely sensitive to extreme cold or heat.Dental grooming is also a must for a Dobermann. Cleaning of ears using ear wipes will help avoid any ear infections or wax buildup.

            They require minimal grooming due to the short fur. Regular bathing will help keep the fur clean. The skin of the Dogue is extremely sensitive to extreme cold
            or heat. Regular brushingof teeth will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup and the mouth remains clean. Their nails grow really fast.So ,the nails of the dog should be
            regularly trimmed and kept short.

            This breed sheds heavily , those who have them at home would know that hair can be seen everywhere.
            The easiest way to avoid this is to brush them everyday. If not brushed regularly then your pet can develop clumps of dirty hair, which will not only
            make the coat look dull but also make it a breeding ground for infections.

            Shih Tzus have a beautiful coat and a matching personality. Daily brushing and combing is necessary to prevent tangles and mats. Their coats are often buzzed short, especially in warm places. When Shih Tzus are about a year old, the coat changes from soft puppy fluff to the silken adult coat. Grooming might be even more challenging at this time as the matting will increase.

            Yorkies are high-maintenance dogs with luxurious coats. Several families resort to keeping the coat on their Yorkies short to facilitate easier grooming. Use a wire pin brush and a stainless steel coat to remove excess hair and keep the coat tangle-free. A Yorkie with dreadlocks is a receptacle for parasites like ticks and fleas. Bathe your Yorkie once a week.

            Impeccable grooming of an Afghan Hound is the only way one can maintain its long and lustrous silky coat. The fur of the hound is very fine in texture,and requires regular brushing and frequent baths.Without which it may become tangled or matted and give an unkempt look. It will be advisable to hire the services of professional pet groomers for new owners. The grooming regime should start at an early age. Grooming also checks the skin for sores or rashes as the long fur can harbour infections if not taken care of.

            Beagles are easy to maintain and groom.They have a smooth water resistant coat which requires regular brushing to encourage blood circulation and hair growth. Even though Beagles shed, their short fur makes it go unnoticed. Regular baths to keep them clean would be required. As a pet parent you would have to check and clean their ears regularly to avoid ear infections. A grooming regime has to be followed to keep Beagles healthy and infection free.

            Borzois are blessed with long, silky coats that may be flat, wavy or even curly and may come in a combination of colours. Even though the silky coat helps keep the dirt and dust away from the fur, regular grooming is advised. A soft brush can be used to comb and groom the fur. Bathing may be advised based on how dirty the dogs gets. It is important to check for infections while grooming.

            This commonly occurs in breeds where the stomach is not attached to the ribs. This can cut off the blood supply to various other parts of the body, which further shuts down the digestion process. Such a situation leads to bloating. It is advisable to not exercise your dog for at least an hour after they have food.

            Although the Kombai’s coat is short and coarse, it is known to shed. However, a good brushing once or twice a week is enough to take care of the shedding. They love a good massage, so turn the grooming session into an indulgent spa session, with the use of gentle strokes with a soft brush or hound mitt.

            The smooth coat Daschund is very easy to maintain. They will require occasional brushing to ensure a smooth and lustrous coat. The Wirehair Daschunds require a little more extensive grooming. They shed lesser than the smooth coat Daschund though. The grooming should start right from when they are puppies or else they become temperamental.

            Indian Pariah dogs do not require much maintenance when it comes to their grooming. They shed throughout the year but the absence of undercoat ensures that you do not see hair all over the house. Regular brushing will minimize this problem. They have less oil glands on the coat, which helps to prevent any odor and also helps them to stay clean.

            Dalmatians are one of the easiest breeds to groom. Blessed with a short coat, the spots on a Dalmatian come in two different colours - black or dark brown on a white base fur. The coat of a Dalmatian requires minimal grooming.Dental grooming is also a must for them. While grooming, check for any rashes or redness in the skin, especially between the paws and the ears.

            It is very easy to confuse this breed for a Pomeranian. Most of the small, white and furry dogs are Spitzes. German Spitzes are easy to train, a little persistence will ensure basic training. Their alert and loyal nature makes them easy to train. Training may be easy but remember that grooming your pet will be a time consuming effort.

            The German Spitz comes in a variety of colors.The common colors include white, orange and black. When it comes to long-hair dogs this is rather a low maintenance breed. It has a silky texture, which does not trap mud or dirt easily. You will need to brush them at least three times a week. These Spitzes shed heavily twice a year. A proper dental and grooming regime should be followed.

            Pugs need plenty of attention in grooming. They shed a whole lot and need regular grooming. Pugs have a double coat: a soft undercoat and a coarser topcoat. The numerous wrinkles on their faces can be a health hazard, if they aren’t cleaned regularly. Moisture trapped in their folds is a great magnet for infections, so remember to dry after you clean.

            Poms require low maintanence but grooming them isn’t the easiest thing. They need to be groomed at least twice a week. They are moderate seasonal shedders. Males shed once a year, while females shed when in heat, soon after they’ve given birth to a litter and when they’re stressed out. During the summer months, it is best to crop the hair shorter.

            Akita's have a double coat.The top coat is straight and the undercoat is soft and dense and this is the one that sheds all year round. This breed is used to living in colder climates so will shed more in warmer climates. You will need to brush the coat at least once a week and in shedding season almost every day. In addition to this you will need to follow a regular grooming regime with your pet.

            Gastric Dilation Volvulus\n
            This commonly occurs in breeds where the stomach is not attached to the ribs. This can cut off the blood supply to various other parts of the body, which further shuts down the digestion process. Such a situation leads to bloating. It is advisable to not exercise your dog for at least an hour after they have food.

            Boxers are one of the easiest breeds to groom.Boxers come in three different fur colours - fawn, brindle and white - with or without markings.They have a  sleek and short coat. The coat of a Boxer requires minimal grooming and often they are known to groom themselves. Boxers can shed quite a bit, so using a soft bristle brush weekly will keep the shedding under control. Regular bathing will help keep the fur clean. Boxer is extremely sensitive to extreme cold or heat.

            Saint Bernards come in two coat types, short-haired and long-haired. The short coat is smooth but dense. The long haired coat, on the other hand, is wavy and the forelegs have a bit of feathering along with a bushy tail. They will need to be brushed at least three to four times a week and need not be bathed regularly.

            Huskies shed twice a year – in spring and in fall. The Siberian Husky has a double coat of medium length hair. The top coat is straight and the undercoat is soft and dense. You will need to brush the coat at least twice a week and, in shedding season, almost every day. They do not have any distinct canine odour.

            The most important thing you need to know is that the diet for dogs doesn’t change much according to the breed type. All the dogs share almost a common diet plan. The only thing that varies is the quantity of food they should have depending on their age or their health conditions.

            Food given to your puppy should be high in calories and nutritional supplements. They should be fed more times a day but in less amount. Initially, puppies just reside on milk till 8 weeks. After that, he/she starts adjusting to the solid food. And do not feed them puppy food for too long.

            It can be little difficult for your dog to shift from kibble food to raw feed as they grow big. But never try to mix both of them as it will only confuse the dog’s digestive system and lead to explosive diarrhea. Dogs may need a couple days to get used to the new food. Don’t feed your dogs any kind of sugary products. It’s harmful.

            Stick to fairly basic foods at first, like turkey and chicken necks. Dogs love to gnaw and chew bones, so this will come natural to them. Once they’ve figured out how to chew, you can start adding different meats. If you want to feed your dog with normal chapattis, rice or vegetables, go for it. It’s perfectly fine.

            If your dog appears to be thriving on the food and has a glossy coat, lots of energy, and a fit appearance, the food agrees with him. If your pet has a dull coat and lacks energy, try another kind of food.

            That depends on the size of the dog, its age, and how much exercise it gets. Assess your pet’s activity level. Working dogs like police dogs may need food which has a higher fat content to provide extra calories. Next, you may need to make adjustments based on your pet’s body condition.

            What should I do if my dog is overweight?\n
            Give less food or switch to a high-fiber, low-calorie dog food. It’s important to not give too much food or your dog won’t lose weight. But it is equally important to give enough, or your dog can lose weight too quickly and become sick.

            How often should my adult dog eat?\n
            Most pet owners prefer feeding an adult dog twice a day, although a dog can eat just once daily. Giving two meals a day may make it easier for the dog to digest the food and helps control hunger.

            Don’t dogs choke on bones?\n
            Not on raw ones. Cooked bones splinter, and they can get lodged in a dog’s throat. Raw bones are pliable, and the calcium content is absolutely integral to a dog’s health. Plus, chewing bones keeps the teeth clean. No more astronomical dental bills!

            What about food-borne bacteria? Isn’t raw meat dangerous?\n
            Wolves seem to do just fine eating days-old carrion. Dogs’ stomachs are equipped to handle bacteria in much the same fashion, so don’t worry about contamination. Still, humans are vulnerable, so wash up!

            What if my dog is constipated?\n
            Again, the straining is actually good for your dog. But if it absolutely refuses to come out, a little raw canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) will do the trick. Raw pumpkin also firms loose stools.

            How much should I feed?\n
            Let’s use a sixty-pound retriever mix as an example. Assuming it gets plenty of exercise, feeding about a pound and a half to two pounds of assorted meats and bones is plenty. Everything varies from dog to dog, of course. If you can’t feel its ribs, reduce the food. If its ribs are a little too prominent, feed more.

            Just meat?\n
            Vegetables can be added to your dog’s diet. In fact, it is recommended. Carrots are fun to crunch, and broccoli, spinach, and celery can be ground up and added to a mixture of ground meat. Supplementing with fish oil is also recommended for a shiny, healthy coat.
