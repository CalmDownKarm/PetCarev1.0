		<text>

			Grooming your Irish Setter takes a lot of time and effort. The long and silky coat needs every day brushing to ensure that it remains soft and lustrous.

			You need to follow the regular grooming regime in your pet i.e brushing the teeth and clipping toe nails. Clipping nails is very important as dog nails have veins in them and if they get chipped then it can be very painful for your pet.

			Regular brushing of teeth will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup and the mouth remains clean. Their nails grow really fast. So, the nails of the dog should be regularly trimmed and kept short.

		<text>

			A Chow Chow has a two layered coat - one rough and one smooth. The top layer of the fur is rough and requires frequent brushing to keep it tangle free and clean.

			Chows are seasonal shedders and shed heavily. They also require regular baths as their fur gets dirty when they play in the yard or garden. Dental grooming is also a must for a Chow Chow. Regular brushing will ensure that there is no tartar or plaque buildup.

		<text>

			Shih Tzus have a beautiful coat and a matching personality. Daily brushing and combing is necessary to prevent tangles and mats. Shih Tzu coats are often buzzed short, especially in warm places.

			When Shih Tzus are about a year old, the coat changes from soft puppy fluff to the silken adult coat. Grooming might be even more challenging at this time, because the matting will increase.

			Borzois are blessed with long, silky coats that may be flat, wavy or even curly and may come in a combination of colours. Even though the silky coat helps keep the dirt and dust away from the fur, regular grooming is advised.

			A soft brush can be used to comb and groom the fur. Bathing may be advised based on how dirty the dog gets. It is important to check for infections while grooming.

			Indian Pariah dogs do not require much maintenance when it comes to their grooming. They shed throughout the year but the absence of undercoat ensures that you do not see hair all over the house.

			Regular brushing will minimize this problem. They have less oil glands on the coat, which prevents any kind of odor and also helps them to stay clean.

			Pugs need plenty of attention in grooming. They shed a lot and need regular grooming. Pugs have a double coat: a soft undercoat and a coarser topcoat.

			The numerous wrinkles on their faces can be a health hazard, if they aren’t cleaned regularly. Moisture trapped in their folds is a great magnet for infections, so remember to dry after you clean.

			Use a wire pin brush and a stainless steel coat to remove excess hair and keep the coat tangle-free. A Yorkie with dreadlocks is a receptacle for parasites like ticks and fleas.

			Shih Tzus have a beautiful coat and a matching personality. Daily brushing and combing is necessary to prevent tangles and mats.

			Shih Tzu coats are often buzzed short, especially in warm places. When Shih Tzus are about a year old, the coat changes from soft puppy fluff to the silken adult coat.

			Grooming might be even more challenging at this time, because the matting will increase.

			Poms require low maintanence but grooming them isn’t the easiest thing. They need to be groomed at least twice a week.

			They are moderate seasonal shedders. Males shed once a year, while females shed when in heat, soon after they’ve given birth to a litter and when they’re stressed out. During the summer months, it is best to crop the hair shorter.

			Boxers are one of the easiest breeds to groom. Boxers come in three different fur colours - fawn, brindle and white - with or without markings. They have a  sleek and short coat. The coat of a Boxer requires minimal grooming.

			Boxers can shed quite a bit, thus using a soft bristle brush weekly will keep the shedding under control. Regular bathing will help keep the fur clean. They are extremely sensitive to extreme cold or heat.

		<text>

			Dobermann is one of the easiest breeds to groom. The coat of a Doberman Pinscher is short and does not shed much, so it require very little grooming.

			Its skin is extremely sensitive to extreme cold or heat. Dental grooming is also a must for a Dobermann. Cleaning of ears using ear wipes will help avoid any ear infections or wax buildup.

			It can be little difficult for your dog to shift from kibble food to raw feed as they grow big. But never try to mix both of them as it will only confuse the dog’s digestive system and lead to explosive diarrhea. Dogs may need a couple days to get used to the new food. Don’t feed your dogs any kind of sugary products as they are harmful.

			That depends on the size of the dog, its age, and how much exercise it gets. Assess your pet’s activity level. Working dogs like police dogs may need food which have a higher fat content to provide extra calories. Next, you may need to make adjustments based on your pet’s body condition.
