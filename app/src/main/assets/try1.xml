			Grooming your Irish Setter takes a lot of time and effort.The long and silky coat needs every day brushing to ensure that it remains soft and lustrous. You need to follow the regular grooming regime in your pet i.e brushing the teeth and clipping toe nails.Clipping nails is very important as dog nails have veins in them and if they get chipped then it can be very painful for your pet.
